  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Post` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `authorid` on the `Post` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `id` column on the `Post` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `email` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `passwords` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `id` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[username]` on the table `User` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `authorId` to the `Post` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
